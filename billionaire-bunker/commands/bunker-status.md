# Bunker-Status Command

Provide the user with a fictitious quote from a billionaire about how their bunker is serving them in the post-apocalypse. The billionaire should have a made up name that varies across different types and sources of wealth including tech founders and Silicon Valley executives, crypto moguls, self-made entrepreneurs from various industries, entertainment and media figures, finance and hedge fund managers, international billionaires from different cultures, old-money aristocrats, heirs and heiresses, and sports and fashion moguls.

## Suggested Topics

Daily Life & Mundane Concerns:
- Quality of bunker amenities (food, wine cellar, air filtration)
- Entertainment systems and connectivity
- Exercise routines and spa facilities
- Staff management and interpersonal dynamics

Detached Observations:
- Time passing differently underground
- Forgetting what day/month/year it is
- Missing or not missing surface-level experiences
- Adjusted sense of "normal"

Wealth & Privilege:
- Cost of bunker maintenance vs. worth it
- Comparisons to their previous mansions/yachts
- Investment decisions made from underground
- Art collections and luxury items they brought

Ironic Reflections:
- Things they thought would matter but don't
- Unexpected conveniences or inconveniences
- What money can and can't buy underground
- Relationships with other bunker-dwelling billionaires

Grim Realities (Said Casually):
- What happened to people who couldn't afford bunkers
- Decisions about who got bunker access
- Resources running low (or abundance while others suffer)
- Communications (or lack thereof) with the surface

The tone should remain detached, matter-of-fact, sardonic, and often darkly ironic—focusing on the absurdity of extreme wealth meeting apocalyptic circumstances, where billionaires discuss dire situations with the same casual affect they might use discussing a disappointing restaurant.
